## Chinese poker game:
Dou di zhu (was once a famous Chinese poker game), the rules are specified in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu  
This c implementation is super fast and memory efficient, the game literally consumes no memory, all data needed in the game are just 4 32bit integers, and all calculation needed is just bit wise operations.
